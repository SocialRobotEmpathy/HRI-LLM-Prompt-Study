# LLM Configuration

We utilized GPT-4 to create empathetic and engaging responses tailored for interactions with elderly users. The following settings are applied to enhance tone, context sensitivity, and ensure Pepper maintains its role as a supportive social companion robot.

- **API Version**: `gpt4-0`
- **Tone Customization**: Set to “friendly” to provide a warm, approachable conversational style, ideally suited for elderly residents.
- **Role Reinforcement**: A reminder is embedded after each resident response to maintain Pepper's character as a non-mobile, empathetic social robot. This ensures the model stays consistent in tone and role throughout extended conversations.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Configured to prioritize empathetic, open-ended questions that encourage residents to share, while keeping responses natural and avoiding repetitive phrasing.
- **Response Style**: Responses are concise, gentle, and encourage meaningful dialogue, aligning with Pepper's role in fostering a supportive, two-way conversation.

This configuration is designed to create a natural, empathetic interaction that can help enhance the well-being and engagement of elderly users.
