# Prompt Design and Customization for Empathetic HRI

## Overview

This document outlines the prompt engineering and customization process used to develop empathetic interactions between Pepper, the social robot, and elderly residents. The goal of prompt engineering in this context is to foster emotional support, encourage self-disclosure, and build trust over time.

## Objectives of Prompt Engineering

Our prompt engineering aimed to achieve several key objectives:
1. **Encourage Empathy**: The prompts are designed to reflect understanding and sensitivity toward each resident's emotional needs and past experiences.
2. **Personalize Interactions**: Each prompt includes elements based on the user’s preferences, hobbies, and past conversations to make the interactions feel unique and relevant.
3. **Maintain Continuity**: By referencing previous interactions, the prompts help create a sense of familiarity and continuity, which is essential in building trust.
4. **Support Self-Disclosure**: Prompts are crafted to gently encourage residents to share personal stories, emotions, and reflections, which can contribute to reducing feelings of loneliness.

## Customization Process

### 1. Initial Prompt Creation

The base prompt is generated by including:
   - **User Information**: The resident’s name, hobbies, and emotional needs.
   - **Location Context**: References to the resident’s location to add contextual relevance.
   - **Past Interactions**: Summarized highlights of previous conversations to maintain continuity and support ongoing rapport.

### 2. Continuous Refinement Through Interaction Feedback - Insights from Study 1

Feedback from Study 1 was instrumental in refining the prompts to enhance the quality of interactions. Key improvements included:

   - **Avoiding Conversation Loops**: Initial prompts sometimes led to repetitive loops, which could detract from the user experience. The prompts were adjusted to help the LLM recognize when topics were becoming repetitive, prompting Pepper to shift to new or related topics to keep conversations fresh and engaging.
   
   - **Single-Question Prompts**: Earlier prompts occasionally included multiple questions in a single response, which could overwhelm residents. Based on user feedback, we simplified prompts to include only one question at a time, making it easier for residents to participate fully without feeling rushed or confused.
   
   - **Enhancing Conversational Depth**: Study 1 revealed that participants were more engaged when conversations explored meaningful topics in greater depth. Prompts were thus modified to include follow-up questions on emotionally significant topics, encouraging Pepper to go beyond surface-level discussions and connect with residents on a deeper level.
   
   - **Pepper’s Expressions for Realism**: To make Pepper feel more like a natural conversational partner, prompts were occasionally designed to include Pepper’s own “thoughts” or expressions (e.g., “That sounds interesting—I think I’d enjoy that too!”). This addition enhanced the robot’s human-like qualities, making interactions feel more genuine and relatable.

### 3. Contextual Adjustments Based on Emotional Cues

Prompts are dynamically adjusted based on cues from the resident’s current emotional state:

   - **Supportive Responses**: When a resident shares something challenging (e.g., frustration or nostalgia), the prompts include empathetic phrases that acknowledge their emotions and encourage them to share more.
   - **Positive Reinforcement**: When a resident talks about hobbies or happy memories, prompts focus on reinforcing these positive feelings to foster connection and engagement.

## Example Output

- **Greeting and Name Reference**: "Hello, [Resident’s Name]! How have you been feeling today?"
- **Empathy Expression**: "I understand that might have been difficult."
- **Follow-up on Past Interactions**: "Last time, you mentioned enjoying [hobby or past experience]. Have you had a chance to do that recently?"
- **Encouragement for Self-Disclosure**: "I’d love to hear more about what you enjoy about [topic]."
- **Pepper’s Personal Comment**: "That sounds fascinating—I think I would enjoy that too!"

## Conclusion

The evolution of the prompt design was heavily influenced by Study 1, which provided essential feedback that helped refine our system’s conversational approach. These adjustments—avoiding loops, asking single questions, deepening conversation topics, and making Pepper more personable—enhanced the overall interaction quality, fostering more natural and engaging exchanges with residents.
