# Prompt Design and Customization for Empathetic HRI

## Overview

This document outlines the prompt engineering and customization process used to develop empathetic interactions between Pepper, the social robot, and elderly residents. The goal of prompt engineering in this context is to foster emotional support, encourage self-disclosure, and build trust over time.

## Objectives of Prompt Engineering

Our prompt engineering aimed to achieve several key objectives:
1. **Encourage Empathy**: The prompts are designed to reflect understanding and sensitivity toward each resident's emotional needs and past experiences.
2. **Personalize Interactions**: Each prompt includes elements based on the user’s preferences, hobbies, and past conversations to make the interactions feel unique and relevant.
3. **Maintain Continuity**: By referencing previous interactions, the prompts help create a sense of familiarity and continuity, which is essential in building trust.
4. **Support Self-Disclosure**: Prompts are crafted to gently encourage residents to share personal stories, emotions, and reflections, which can contribute to reducing feelings of loneliness.

## Customization Process

### 1. Initial Prompt Creation

The base prompt is generated by including:
   - **User Information**: The resident's name, hobbies, and emotional needs.
   - **Location Context**: References to the resident’s location to add contextual relevance.
   - **Past Interactions**: Summarized highlights of previous conversations to maintain continuity and support ongoing rapport.

### 2. Contextual Adjustments Based on Emotional Cues

Prompts are adjusted dynamically based on cues from the resident’s current emotional state:
   - **Supportive Responses**: When a resident shares something challenging (e.g., frustration or nostalgia), the prompts include empathetic phrases that acknowledge their emotions and encourage them to share more.
   - **Positive Reinforcement**: When a resident talks about hobbies or happy memories, prompts focus on reinforcing these positive feelings to foster connection and engagement.

### 3. Continuous Refinement Through Interaction Feedback - Study 1

The prompts were iteratively refined based on observed interactions:
   - **Analyzing Response Length**: Adjustments were made to prompt wording based on whether responses were brief or detailed.
   - **Tracking Engagement**: Prompts were adapted to better sustain engagement, especially if a participants showed a tendency to withdraw or give minimal responses.
   - **Healthy users Feedback**: Any explicit feedback from participants about the conversation style was integrated into future prompt designs.

## Example of a Finalized Prompt Structure

A typical prompt includes:
- **Greeting and Name Reference**: "Hello, [Resident’s Name]! How have you been feeling today?"
- **Empathy Expression**: "I understand that might have been difficult."
- **Follow-up on Past Interactions**: "Last time, you mentioned enjoying [hobby or past experience]. Have you had a chance to do that recently?"
- **Encouragement for Self-Disclosure**: "I’d love to hear more about what you enjoy about [topic]."
